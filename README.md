# Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple command-line version of the popular Tic Tac Toe game created in Java. The game is played by two players, one using 'X' and the other using 'O', taking turns to mark spaces on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## How to Play
To play the game, simply run the main method of the TicTacToe class. The game board will be displayed on the console, and players will be prompted to enter a number from 1 to 9 to make their move. The numbers correspond to the spaces on the game board as follows:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>9</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Enter the number corresponding to the space you want to mark. If the space is available, your mark will be placed there and the board will be updated. If the space is already occupied, you will be prompted to enter a different number.

The game will continue until one player wins or the board is full, resulting in a tie. At the end of the game, the winner will be displayed on the console.

## Improvements
There are several improvements that could be made to this game, including:

-Adding a graphical interface to make the game more user-friendly
-Allowing players to choose their symbol (currently fixed as 'X' and 'O')
-Implementing a more sophisticated computer player with varying levels of difficulty
-Adding the ability to play against other human players online
